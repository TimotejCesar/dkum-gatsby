Employees of the University of Maribor can upload their work into DKUM. To do this, you need to [log into](https://dk.um.si/prijava.php?lang=eng) DKUM using the ArnesAAI authentication system. Use your UM identity credentials when asked for username and password. After successful login choose the "Employee's work upload" and follow the instructions on each page.

As an authenticated user you can edit your user profile and add links to your profiles in other web repositories or data collections, like COBISS, ARRS, GoogleScholar, ResearchGate etc. Any link you add is shown on personal bibliography under mentor statistics.
