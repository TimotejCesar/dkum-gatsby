DISSERTATIONS UPLOAD TO PROQUEST DATABASE DISSERTATIONS & THESES GLOBAL

In the academic year 2012/2013, the submission of the university PhD dissertations into ProQuest's international bibliographic database Dissertations and Theses was introduced at the University of Maribor. The University of Maribor therefore became a part of the universities that systematically collect the original scientific work under the auspices of the internationally established Proquest database, which serves as the primary source for searching r such information. 154 PhD theses of the University of Maribor are in this database until today.

The University of Maribor has signed an agreement with Proquest to replace individual uploading with harvesting of the PhD dissertations of University of Maribor students from the University of Maribor Digital Library. Submission to the ProQuest Dissertations & Theses database is carried out automatically through the OAI-PMH server DKUM.

According to the Article 41 of the Rules of Doctoral Studies at the University of Maribor (No: 012/2018/1), the conditions for the publication of the PhD dissertations in the ProQuest Dissertations & Theses database are equivalent to the conditions for publication in the University of Maribor Digital Library.
